CUSTOM EDITOR ROM (UD7)
-----------------------
Label:              "4080 9" E0 60hz"
Type:               EPROM (appears to have tape covering window)
Purpose:            Custom editor ROM for 9-inch screen operation
                    - Supports 40-column display mode
                    - Configured for 9-inch monitor (4032-9 variant)
                    - NTSC 60Hz refresh rate
                    - May include 40/80 column switching capability
Significance:       Custom-burned ROM specifically for 4032-9 models to allow
                    the Universal Dynamic PET board (8032089) to work properly 
                    with a 9-inch screen. Standard 4032-12 editor ROMs expect 
                    a 12-inch screen. Likely created by Commodore or authorized 
                    service center. Important for preservation as the 4032-9 
                    variant was less common than the 4032-12.

EXPANSION ROM: COMMAND-O (UD11)
--------------------------------

                    - Additional utility commands
Significance:       Popular third-party enhancement for PET development work.
                    Indicates this machine was used for serious programming.

EXPANSION ROM: COM40U (UD12)
-----------------------------
Location:           UD12 ($A000-$AFFF, 40960-45055 decimal)
Chip Label:         MOS 1980 COM40U 0981
Manufacturer:       MOS Technology (Commodore)
Date Code:          0981 (September 1981)
Activation:         SYS 40960 (also SYS 40961, 40962)
Type:               Official Commodore utility ROM
Function:           Machine language monitor/debugger (TIM-like)
                    - Entry points at $A000, $A001, $A002
                    - Provides debugging and development capabilities
                    - Specific to 40-column configurations
Purpose:            COM40U likely stands for "Commodore 40-column Utility"
                    This ROM was probably bundled with some 4032 models or
                    available as an aftermarket add-on to provide enhanced
                    development tools.
Significance:       Rare/undocumented Commodore official ROM. May be one of
                    few surviving examples. First byte is $3E (62 decimal),
                    not standard JMP instruction, suggesting specialized
                    initialization or banking logic.
Notes:              SYS to $A000-$A002 drops into TIM monitor
                    SYS to higher addresses ($A028+) causes crash
                    No readable text strings in first 60 bytes
                    This ROM warrants further documentation and preservation

MACHINE HISTORY & CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------
This machine is a factory Commodore PET 4032-N with aftermarket enhancements:

1. FACTORY CONFIGURATION (circa 1980-1981)
   - Commodore PET 4032-N (9-inch NTSC variant)
   - The 4032 series came in two main versions:

Keyboard:           Full-size graphics keyboard layout
I/O:                IEEE-488, User port, 2x Cassette ports

NOTABLE QUIRKS
--------------
1. BYTE-SWAPPED END-OF-BASIC POINTER
   - PEEK(43)+PEEK(44)*256 returns 43,789 instead of expected ~3,500
   - Value is $AB0D (reversed from expected $0DAB)
   - Programs load and run correctly despite this anomaly
   - FRE(0) returns correct values
   - This quirk is undocumented in known PET literature
   - May be related to custom editor ROM or board revision
   - Not a functional problem, just unusual behavior

2. 9-INCH SCREEN CONFIGURATION
   - The 4032-9 variant is less common than the 4032-12 (12-inch)
   - Custom editor ROM (UD7) enables proper 9-inch operation
   - This configuration is authentic factory spec, not an upgrade

PERIPHERAL DEVICES
------------------
Connected:          PETdisk MAX v3 (SD card IEEE-488 interface)
                    Device 8, with custom configuration

PRESERVATION NOTES
------------------
Date Documented:    December 17, 2025
Last Updated:       December 18, 2025
Documented By:      Owner (Vance Thompson) working with AI assistant (Claude)
Condition:          Fully functional, all systems operational
Special Care:       - Custom editor ROM (UD7) is important for 4032-9 preservation
                    - Consider backing up/dumping all ROMs for preservation
                    - COM40U ROM (UD12) appears undocumented - HIGH PRIORITY
                    - ROMs should be dumped and shared with preservation community

ROM DUMPS COMPLETED
-------------------
Date:               December 18, 2025
Files Created:      - pet-4032-editor-9inch-60hz.bin (UD7)
                    - pet-command-o-rob-chang-1980.bin (UD11)
                    - pet-com40u-mos-0981.bin (UD12)

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS
-----------------------
- All BASIC 4.0 commands functional (DLOAD, DSAVE, COPY, SCRATCH, etc.)
- IEEE-488 disk operations work correctly via PETdisk MAX
- Keyboard fully functional
- Display clear and readable
- Programs can be created using custom Python tokenizer for PET BASIC 2.0/4.0

TOKENIZER INFORMATION
---------------------
A custom Python tokenizer was developed for this PET to properly create
.PRG files with correct:
- PET BASIC 2.0/4.0 token values (PRINT=$99, END=$80, etc.)
- Proper load address ($0401 for PET)
- Correct line link pointers
- Proper operator tokenization (=, <, >, +, -, *, /, etc.)

The tokenizer creates binary-compatible PRG files that match PET-native
saved files byte-for-byte.

TECHNICAL DISCOVERIES
---------------------
During development, the following PET BASIC tokenization rules were
confirmed:
- Operators (=, <, >, etc.) must be tokenized as single bytes
- Keywords require word-boundary checking to avoid false matches
- Line link pointers point to next line's link address in memory
- Memory address formula: load_addr + (file_offset - 2)

ROM Dumping discoveries:
- OPEN channel 2 required for proper sequential file writing
- Format "0:filename,S,W" prevents multiple file creation
- PRINT#1 with semicolon suppresses line breaks in sequential files
- PETdisk adds .SEQ extension to sequential files automatically
