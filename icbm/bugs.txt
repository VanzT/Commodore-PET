ICBM GAME - OUTSTANDING BUGS & FEATURE REQUESTS
================================================================================
Last Updated: 2024-12-23

DISPLAY & USABILITY ISSUES
================================================================================

1. ACTIVATION COUNT ACCURACY & CLARITY
   - Currently shows activation roll result even when no missiles remain
   - Should show actual number of missiles that CAN be activated
   - If USSR has 10 inactive missiles but rolls 18, should show "10" not "18"
   - If USSR has 0 inactive missiles, should show "0" regardless of roll
   
   Proposed display improvements:
   USA: "CAN ACTIVATE: 6 OUT OF XX MISSILES"
        (where XX = total inactive missiles remaining)
   
   USSR: "U.S.S.R. ACTIVATES: XX MISSILES OUT OF YY REMAINING"
         (where XX = min(roll result, inactive missiles))
         (where YY = total inactive missiles)
   
   This gives both players better situational awareness of remaining forces.

NOTES
================================================================================
- Both pause features have been implemented
- USA player now has time to physically move counters on the map

================================================================================
COMPLETED FIXES (DO NOT RE-IMPLEMENT)
================================================================================
- Variable name conflicts (2-character limit issues)
- Duplicate line numbers in city data
- Hex distance calculation (was Manhattan, now proper hex)
- City coordinates (all 22 USA cities corrected)
- Activation chart formulas (now match physical map)
- USSR targeting (now spreads fire across multiple cities)
- ABM spam reduction (only shows when in range)
- Display formatting improvements
- USSR movement display optimization
- PAUSE ON USSR MISSILE IMPACT - Implemented (waits for keypress after impact)
- PAUSE WHEN SCREEN FILLS - Implemented (pauses every 20 lines during USSR movement)
