DISPLAY & USABILITY ISSUES
================================================================================

1. USA MISSILE SELECTION DURING ACTIVATION
   - Currently USA activation automatically picks first available missiles
   - No control over which specific missiles to launch from which bases
   - Player should be able to choose specific missile types and bases each turn
   
   Example scenario:
   - Turn 1: Want to launch 3x MX-3 missiles from Base A
   - Turn 2: Want to launch 1x Titan II and 1x Minuteman II from same Base A
   
   Current system doesn't allow this strategic choice - it just activates the
   first N missiles it finds regardless of type or location.
   
   Proposed solution:
   - During USA activation phase, show list of bases with missile inventory
   - Let player select which base to activate from
   - Show missile types available in that base
   - Let player choose which specific missiles to activate
   - Repeat until activation count is exhausted or player is done
   
   This would give USA player tactical control over force composition per turn,
   matching the strategic depth of the physical board game.

2. USSR AI ABM-AWARE TARGETING
   - Currently USSR AI uses spread-fire targeting (targets highest-value cities
     with <3 missiles already assigned)
   - Does not consider USA ABM defenses when selecting targets
   - Should factor in ABM site density when choosing between similar targets
   
   Proposed enhancement:
   - Count USA ABM sites within 3 hexes of each candidate city
   - When choosing between cities of similar value, prefer lightly-defended ones
   - Still maintain spread-fire logic (don't send >3 missiles to same city)
   - Balance between city value and ABM defense strength
   
   This would make USSR AI more tactically realistic - avoiding heavily defended
   targets when possible, similar to real nuclear doctrine.
   
   Note: Code structure already supports this - line 8362 area is where ABM
   density check would be added.

NOTES
================================================================================
- Both pause features have been implemented
- USA player now has time to physically move counters on the map

================================================================================
COMPLETED FIXES (DO NOT RE-IMPLEMENT)
================================================================================
- Variable name conflicts (2-character limit issues)
- Duplicate line numbers in city data
- Hex distance calculation (was Manhattan, now proper hex)
- City coordinates (all 22 USA cities corrected)
- Activation chart formulas (now match physical map)
- USSR targeting (now spreads fire across multiple cities)
- ABM spam reduction (only shows when in range)
- Display formatting improvements
- USSR movement display optimization
- PAUSE ON USSR MISSILE IMPACT - Implemented (waits for keypress after impact)
- PAUSE WHEN SCREEN FILLS - Implemented (pauses every 20 lines during USSR movement)
- ACTIVATION COUNT ACCURACY - Implemented (shows actual available missiles, caps at inventory)
